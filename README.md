# Web-Scrapping-using-youtube-API
This Project involves Web Scrapping youtube data of Akshat Shrivastava and KSI (JJOlatunji).I have leveraged YouTube API to get this data into python and do some basic manipulations to get some neat final output with total views and total subscribers for both the channels.

• First install some necessary Google API packages. 

• After that, generate some API key credentials to access the YouTube data.

• Once we have done that, use the YouTube API documentation for channels and use the python code there to generate some information on the above mentioned channels. 

• I have used loops and dictionary concept to neatly extract the data which will be in some JSON format.
